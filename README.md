# Weather Dashboard

### Jason Duran

## Description
The objective was to use React to create a dynamic and interactive weather-dashboard. Tailwind is used to style everything and Typescript keeps everything type-safe.

## User Story

```md
AS A user 
I WANT to easily view the weather for any city
SO THAT I can be informed ahead of time
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN A weather dashboard with a search bar
WHEN I open the site 
THEN the default city(Denver) will be displayed
WHEN I enter a city 
THEN the current day's weather and the 5 day forcast will show up 
WHEN I enter a city 
THEN the city will be saved to local storage
```
